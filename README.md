DBSCAN and k-Reverse Nearest Neighbor based clustering algorithms

DBSCAN clustering algorithm is an implementation of the paper 'Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)'. It is a data clustering algorithm proposed by Martin Ester, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Jörg Sander and Xiaowei Xu in 1996.

# k-Reverse Nearest Neighbor based clustering algorithms: 

In these algorithms, data’s underlying patterns are captured by using the concept and properties of reverse nearest neighbors. 

My dissertation titled 'Reverse Nearest Neighbors Driven Clustering and Visualization of High Dimensional Data' elaborates on the properties and behavior of reverse nearest neighbor sets useful in the process of detecting outliers and identifying clusters. 

In this repository, we provide two types of kRNN clustering algorithms that have these micro-steps: 
1. identify candidate outliers, 
2. identify clusters, 
3. identify local outliers, 
4. obtain agglomerative clustering and
5. obtain most stable clustering result.
